 <font color="" size="6"> Th e Targeted Malicious Email Challenge
A network defender encounters diff erent classes
of threat actors with varying intents and capabili-
ties. Conventional computer network att acks exploit
network-based listening services such as Web serv-

especially dangerous because nearly all organizations
allow email to enter their networks.
